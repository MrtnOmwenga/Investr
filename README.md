## Investr

Investr is a financial management platform that I developed using Python, SQLAlchemy, and Flask. It's designed to empower users to track and manage their investment portfolios in real-time. The platform provides access to live financial data, enabling users to monitor the performance of their investments. Investr is a valuable tool for individuals seeking to make well-informed financial decisions and manage their investment strategies effectively.
